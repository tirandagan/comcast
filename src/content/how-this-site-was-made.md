# How This Site Was Made

## The Journey from Document to Interactive Experience

This microsite represents a fascinating intersection of traditional content creation and cutting-edge AI-powered development. What began as a comprehensive strategic document evolved into an immersive, interactive web experience – all built in record time using Claude Code, an AI pair programming assistant.

## Starting with the Content: From Word to Markdown

### What is Markdown?

Think of Markdown as a simple way to format text using plain characters. Instead of clicking buttons in Microsoft Word to make text **bold** or *italic*, you type simple symbols. For example:
- `**bold text**` becomes **bold text**
- `*italic text*` becomes *italic text*
- `# Big Heading` becomes a large title

Markdown is beloved by developers because it's:
- **Human-readable** – you can understand it without any special software
- **Version-control friendly** – changes are easy to track
- **Convertible** – transforms easily into websites, PDFs, or other formats

### The Conversion Process

The original Sutherland report was written in a traditional word processor. To transform it into this website, we:

1. **Exported to plain text** – Stripped away all the complex formatting
2. **Added Markdown formatting** – Replaced styling with simple markers
3. **Structured for the web** – Organized content into chapters and sections
4. **Enhanced with metadata** – Added descriptions and navigation information

## Building with Claude Code: AI-Powered Development
