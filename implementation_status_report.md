# Chapter 1 Loading Issue - Investigation Report

## Issue Summary
Chapter 1 was showing "Failed to load chapter" error when clicked in the microsite.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Slug Mismatch
The primary issue was a slug mismatch between different parts of the system:
- **report-data.ts**: Uses slug `data-ai-current-state-vision`
- **report-parser.ts**: Generates slug `data-ai-at-comcast-current-state-and-vision` from the chapter title
- **InteractiveChapterView.tsx**: Was looking for slug `company-overview-and-current-landscape` (legacy from Sutherland report)

### 2. Legacy Code
The InteractiveChapterView component contained legacy code from a previous Sutherland report that was looking for sections like "About Sutherland Global Services" which don't exist in the Comcast report.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Slug Matching
Changed the slug check in InteractiveChapterView.tsx from:
```typescript
if (chapter.slug === 'company-overview-and-current-landscape')
```
to:
```typescript
if (chapter.slug === 'data-ai-at-comcast-current-state-and-vision')
```

### 2. Updated Chapter 1 Interactive Components
Replaced the legacy Sutherland-specific section lookups with proper Comcast-themed interactive components that get injected into Chapter 1:
- HeroDashboard
- ServiceEcosystem
- GlobalNetworkMap
- IndustryVerticalExplorer
- InnovationInfrastructure

### 3. Removed Interactive View Toggle
As requested, removed the "Interactive View" toggle button since the microsite should always be highly visual and interactive. The static report is available through the "View Complete Report" button.

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/components/report/InteractiveChapterView.tsx`
   - Fixed slug matching for Chapter 1
   - Updated interactive component injection for Comcast content
   - Removed Interactive View toggle button
   - Removed useState import and interactiveMode state

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Slug Consistency**: There's still inconsistency between `report-data.ts` and `report-parser.ts` in how they generate slugs. This should be addressed to prevent future issues.

2. **Chapter 1 Visualizations**: The Chapter1Visualizations.tsx components exist and are imported in markdown-renderer.tsx, but they may need to be updated to match Comcast's actual data and branding.

3. **Content Verification**: The actual Chapter 1 content from the markdown file should be verified to ensure all the interactive components align with the written content.

## Next Steps

1. Test Chapter 1 loading in the running application
2. Verify that all interactive components render correctly
3. Consider standardizing slug generation across the application
4. Update any remaining Sutherland-specific references to Comcast

## Status
✅ Chapter 1 slug issue identified and fixed
✅ Interactive View toggle removed as requested
⚠️ Full testing required to confirm Chapter 1 loads properly
