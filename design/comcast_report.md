# Transforming Comcast Through Data & AI: A Strategic Vision for the Chief Data & AI Officer Role

## Executive Summary

Comcast stands at a pivotal moment in its evolution. With petabytes of data flowing through our networks daily, serving over 32 million customers, and operating across multiple business units—from Xfinity to NBCUniversal to Sky—we possess unparalleled data assets. Yet, our current data monetization efforts yield modest results relative to our potential.

As your Chief Data & AI Officer, I will transform Comcast into a data-driven powerhouse, unlocking $2B+ in new revenue streams while reducing operational costs by 30% through AI-powered automation. My vision builds on proven success: at Cognizant, I built the Industry Solutions Group from zero to $200M in revenue, leading 400 professionals in delivering AI-driven transformation.

# Current Data Monetization Landscape at Comcast (2022–2025)

Comcast Corporation (including its U.S. Xfinity brands and international arm Sky) has increasingly emphasized data-driven products to diversify revenue. In recent years Comcast has rolled out new advertising platforms, smart venue solutions, and enterprise networking services aimed at leveraging first‑party data. For example, Comcast Advertising (formerly Effectv) has launched advanced _addressable_ and _performance_ TV/OTT ad products, and Comcast Smart Solutions now offers video‑analytics and digital signage for retailers and municipalities[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/introducing-comcast-advertisings-media-solutions#:~:text=The%20Media%20Solutions%20team%20will,media%2C%20data%20and%20technology%20assets)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Comcast%20Smart%20Solutions%2C%20a%20division,Digital%20Signage%20solutions%20to%20customers). Despite these initiatives, analysts note that results are modest: management has signaled that current data‑monetization outcomes fall short of expectations. This report surveys Comcast’s data monetization strategies from 2022–2025, summarizes their revenue/impact, lists key customers and partners, and explores opportunity areas (for both consumer and B2B markets) along with the data sources that would support them.

## Current Data Monetization Initiatives

### Addressable and Performance Advertising

Comcast’s core data asset is its massive video/broadband subscriber base (nearly 125 million U.S. households across cable and streaming[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/introducing-comcast-advertisings-media-solutions#:~:text=More%20than%20ever%2C%20our%20solutions,States%20across%20all%20210%20DMAs)). Comcast Advertising has unified its ad sales under the Comcast brand and introduced a new “Media Solutions” team to simplify buying across linear TV, streaming, and multiscreen[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/introducing-comcast-advertisings-media-solutions#:~:text=The%20Media%20Solutions%20team%20will,media%2C%20data%20and%20technology%20assets). In April 2025 Comcast launched the _Universal Ads_ platform to allow brands (even small businesses) to buy and target ads across Comcast’s premium video inventory. These moves lean on first‑party data for precise audience targeting and better measurement. For example, Comcast partnered with Mastercard to match aggregated ad exposure to real consumer spending (by ZIP code)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is). It also extended FreeWheel attribution tools with PlaceIQ so that ad impressions can be linked to physical foot traffic (e.g. store visits)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=%2A%20Location,performance%20while%20protecting%20user%20privacy). These innovations aim to turn TV into a “performance” channel like digital.

The early payoffs are visible but modest. According to industry data, Comcast’s addressable advertising revenue grew to $378 million in Q2 2025 (an 18% increase year‑over‑year)[monexa.ai](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/comcast-s-strategic-pivot-advertising-streaming-an-CMCSA-2025-06-17#:~:text=The%20impact%20of%20this%20strategic,These%20figures). The number of advertisers using Comcast’s new solutions jumped 68% in that period, and average spend per advertiser rose about 12%[monexa.ai](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/comcast-s-strategic-pivot-advertising-streaming-an-CMCSA-2025-06-17#:~:text=The%20impact%20of%20this%20strategic,These%20figures). Still, by itself $378M per quarter is small relative to Comcast’s ~$30B annual revenues, reflecting that video ad sales are just one piece of the business. Peacock’s streaming ads (part of NBCUniversal Media) hit record highs (ad revenue +50% in Q4 2023)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-tops-revenue-estimates-streaming-theme-park-growth-offset-broadband-2024-01-25/#:~:text=Revenue%20at%20the%20company%27s%20Peacock,fourth%20quarter%2C%20to%2031%20million), but most gains are in content licensing and subscription.

### Digital Out‑of‑Home and Venue Analytics

Beyond TV, Comcast Smart Solutions (formerly Comcast Business Smart Communities) is rolling out digital signage and video analytics to monetize its network connections in public venues. In June 2024 Comcast announced partnerships with Creative Realities and Quantela to offer end‑to‑end digital signage systems (interactive kiosks, LED boards, menu screens) with analytics capabilities[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Comcast%20Smart%20Solutions%2C%20a%20division,Digital%20Signage%20solutions%20to%20customers)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Quantela%20specializes%20in%20end,edge%20features). These solutions bundle Comcast’s connectivity with third‑party hardware and software to help businesses engage customers. For example, Quantela’s platform emphasizes _data monetization through Digital Out‑of‑Home (DOOH) advertising_[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Quantela%20specializes%20in%20end,edge%20features). In practice, a mall or restaurant could display targeted ads on Comcast‑powered screens and use built‑in analytics to measure impressions and engagement. Similarly, Comcast’s video‑analytics services can track foot traffic and heat maps in stores or buildings, enabling clients (retailers, airports, campuses) to optimize layouts and staffing[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/blogs-and-webinars/benefits-of-video-analytics-for-businesses/#:~:text=Customer%20traffic%20and%20heat%20mapping,analysis).

These smart‑venue products rely on data from CCTV cameras, Wi‑Fi access points and IoT sensors. For instance, a store’s Wi‑Fi or Bluetooth beacons can anonymously count visitors or detect dwell time. Comcast’s MachineQ IoT (LoRa sensors) and DeepBlue Wi-Fi services add further data feeds. While specific revenues aren’t public, Comcast pitches these solutions by citing customer ROI – e.g. Quantela claims 3× return on ad spend and higher foot traffic for certain home‑improvement campaigns[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is). Key customers include commercial real estate firms, retail chains, quick-serve restaurants, and stadiums/arenas (e.g. Wells Fargo Center) that deploy Comcast’s 5G/LTE networks and digital displays[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Comcast%20Business%20today%20announced%20it,solution%20and%20digitalization%20enabler%20platform)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Creative%20Realities%2C%20Inc,prioritize%20key%20areas%20such%20as).

### Private 5G and Enterprise Networking

Comcast Business has expanded into private wireless networks and IoT services for enterprises and venues. Starting in 2022 it partnered with Nokia to deploy private LTE/5G networks (using Nokia’s Digital Automation Cloud) in places like sports arenas[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Comcast%20Business%20today%20announced%20it,solution%20and%20digitalization%20enabler%20platform). These networks give enterprises high‑bandwidth coverage (e.g. throughout a stadium or factory) and low-latency IoT connectivity. The real monetization opportunity is the data layer: an enterprise’s private 5G network can generate location data (e.g. tracking fans, equipment, or inventory) and quality-of-service metrics. Comcast can bundle analytics on this data as a service – for example, stadiums might use it to manage crowd flows or advertisers might tie it to in-venue ads. Comcast emphasizes that government agencies and large enterprises are prime customers for these mission‑critical networks[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Enterprise%20businesses%2C%20as%20well%20as,expanding%20ecosystem%20of%20connected%20devices). To support this, Comcast Business supplements 5G with its MachineQ and DeepBlue IoT platforms, offering end‑to-end data collection (from sensors to the cloud)[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Private%20wireless%20networks%20enhance%20Comcast,businesses%20better%20prepare%20for%20the).

### International Expansion (Sky)

Since acquiring Sky (the European pay-TV group), Comcast has integrated Sky’s assets into its ad and data strategy. In 2024–25 Comcast launched a Global Media Solutions team to sell ad campaigns across the U.S., UK and Europe[comcastadvertising.com](https://comcastadvertising.com/news/comcast-advertising-announces-international-expansion-and-launch-of-new-global-media-solutions-team/#:~:text=London%20%E2%80%93%2028%20April%2C%202025,its%20portfolio%20of%20premium%20inventory)[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/introducing-comcast-advertisings-media-solutions#:~:text=To%20better%20serve%20the%20needs,group%20headquartered%20out%20of%20London). Comcast is leveraging NBCU and Sky premium inventory (including live sports) in combined offerings. Notably, Comcast helped broker a UK advertising marketplace: Sky, ITV and Channel 4 are creating a unified addressable-TV platform (slated for 2026) powered by Comcast’s Universal Ads and FreeWheel technology[comcastadvertising.com](https://comcastadvertising.com/news/sky-channel-4-and-itv-announce-joint-intent-to-launch-groundbreaking-premium-video-advertising-marketplace/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20small,and%20its%20Universal%20Ads%20platform)[comcastadvertising.com](https://comcastadvertising.com/news/sky-channel-4-and-itv-announce-joint-intent-to-launch-groundbreaking-premium-video-advertising-marketplace/#:~:text=marketplace%2C%20which%20is%20set%20to,Ads%20platform%20and%20FreeWheel%E2%80%99s%20technology). This collaboration (announced June 2024) will let advertisers – especially small/medium businesses – buy a single targeted TV campaign across all three broadcasters, using Comcast’s data-driven auction tools. In short, Comcast is opening access to Sky Media’s audiences with the same performance‑marketing approach used in the U.S.

## Partners and Customers

-   Advertisers & Agencies: National brands and media agencies are the end customers for Comcast’s ad products. Advertiser case studies (Home Improvement, automotive, retail) have been cited in Comcast materials[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is). Smaller businesses can self-serve via Universal Ads.
-   Content Partners: NBCUniversal, Sky, local broadcast channels and streaming services supply the premium content inventory that attracts audiences. Comcast collaborates with programmers to integrate its addressable tools.
-   Technology & Data Partners: Comcast has formed partnerships to enhance its data tools: e.g. Mastercard (transaction data for offline attribution)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is); PlaceIQ (location/audience data)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=%2A%20Location,performance%20while%20protecting%20user%20privacy); Marpipe (product catalog ads for CTV)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,Marpipe%E2%80%99s%20creative%20automation%20to%20the); Quantela and Creative Realities (DOOH analytics)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Quantela%20specializes%20in%20end,edge%20features); Nokia (private 5G)[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Comcast%20Business%20today%20announced%20it,solution%20and%20digitalization%20enabler%20platform). FreeWheel (a Comcast subsidiary) provides the buying infrastructure.
-   Enterprise & Venues: Major sports and entertainment venues (e.g. Wells Fargo Center) use Comcast’s private networks and digital signage[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-business-collaborates-with-nokia-to-drive-innovation-in-5g-private-wireless-networking#:~:text=Comcast%20Business%20today%20announced%20it,solution%20and%20digitalization%20enabler%20platform). Hotels, malls, stadiums, campuses, and cities are clients for Smart Solutions (video analytics, smart lighting, mobility).
-   International Broadcasters: Sky Media (U.K.), Canal+ (France), and other networks in Europe may participate via Comcast’s international advertising initiatives[comcastadvertising.com](https://comcastadvertising.com/news/comcast-advertising-announces-international-expansion-and-launch-of-new-global-media-solutions-team/#:~:text=London%20%E2%80%93%2028%20April%2C%202025,its%20portfolio%20of%20premium%20inventory)[comcastadvertising.com](https://comcastadvertising.com/news/sky-channel-4-and-itv-announce-joint-intent-to-launch-groundbreaking-premium-video-advertising-marketplace/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20small,and%20its%20Universal%20Ads%20platform).

Comcast’s own divisions (Xfinity, Comcast Business, Sky) are customers in a sense—they supply the data and deploy the products. For example, Xfinity Internet viewership and Wi‑Fi data are sources and can be used internally for product features (like ad personalization on X1 or Peacock).

## Financial Impact

Comcast does not separately report “data monetization” revenue, but trends in advertising give a proxy. As noted, addressable TV/streaming ad sales (the core data-driven product) showed double‑digit growth: e.g. 18% YoY in Q2 2025[monexa.ai](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/comcast-s-strategic-pivot-advertising-streaming-an-CMCSA-2025-06-17#:~:text=The%20impact%20of%20this%20strategic,These%20figures). In its earnings reports, Comcast highlights overall Media segment growth (+5.7% in Q4 2023) driven by higher distribution fees (Peacock subscriptions and ad revenue)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-tops-revenue-estimates-streaming-theme-park-growth-offset-broadband-2024-01-25/#:~:text=Comcast%20reported%20a%205.7,5%20billion). Peacock streaming ad revenue alone topped $1.03 billion in Q4 2023[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-tops-revenue-estimates-streaming-theme-park-growth-offset-broadband-2024-01-25/#:~:text=Revenue%20at%20the%20company%27s%20Peacock,fourth%20quarter%2C%20to%2031%20million) (up 50% excluding special events).

Comcast Business (broadband, networking, enterprise) posted flat-to‑slightly declining revenues in late 2023, with stiff competition from telcos. The revenue impact of new data services (video analytics, IoT) is modest and often bundled with connectivity. For example, the Wells Fargo Center project was framed as a $300 million venue upgrade, but Comcast’s role is largely as a bidder within that. No public figure breaks out how much Comcast earns from selling analytics or content data specifically. In marketing materials, some Comcast partners claim strong ROI (e.g. _“3x incremental return on ad spend”_ in a case study[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,order%20value%20and%20consumer%20spend)), but these are selective.

Overall, data-based offerings appear to be a growth strategy for Comcast’s lower-margin segments. Executives have noted that these businesses are still nascent – for instance, new performance ad tools just launched mid‑2025 – and will take time to mature. The mixed results so far reflect heavy investment (e.g. building universal ad tech) with gradual uptake by clients.

## Opportunities for Enhanced Data Monetization

Even as Comcast ramps up current initiatives, many _new opportunities_ remain to turn its data into revenue. Below we list key ideas, broken into consumer-focused and B2B/enterprise domains. For each we note the types of data sources that could enable these use cases.

### Consumer-Side Opportunities

-   Enhanced Targeted TV/Streaming Ads: Comcast can further monetize Xfinity consumption data. By integrating its detailed viewership logs (from cable boxes, Xumo streaming, Peacock, Xfinity apps) with identity graphs and location data, Comcast could offer highly personalized ad targeting. For example, a household that streams cooking shows and lives near a grocery chain might see targeted supermarket ads. _Data sources:_ first-party viewing history and cable Wi-Fi usage; opt‑in customer profile data; third-party demographic segments. (This builds on current addressable ads[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is)[corporate.comcast.com](https://corporate.comcast.com/stories/introducing-comcast-advertisings-media-solutions#:~:text=The%20Media%20Solutions%20team%20will,media%2C%20data%20and%20technology%20assets).)
-   Smart Home and IoT Analytics: Leverage data from Xfinity Home (security cameras, sensors) and xFi (home routers) to create new services. For instance, Comcast could analyze anonymized network traffic trends to advise customers on IoT usage or energy savings. It might also offer subscription-based home analytics dashboards. _Data:_ aggregated home network usage, IoT device activity (motion detectors, thermostats), all captured by Comcast’s gateways.
-   Media/Content Analytics Products: Comcast could package aggregated content usage insights for partners. For example, it might sell Nielsen-like streaming audience reports to networks (show popularity by region or demographics). _Data:_ anonymized, privacy-compliant view counts and engagement from Peacock, Xfinity on-demand, and Sky platforms (especially combined across markets).
-   Xfinity Mobile Location Services: For customers on Xfinity Mobile, Comcast could (with permission) offer location-based app services or analytics. E.g., a traffic app using real-time aggregated commute data from Comcast’s network. _Data:_ cell tower/Wi-Fi location pings, anonymized from subscriber devices.

### B2B/Enterprise Opportunities

-   Retail Foot-Traffic Analytics: Combine physical location data from Comcast’s networks with consumer profiles. For instance, use footfall data from Wi‑Fi sensors or private 5G at a shopping mall, merge with third‑party insights (credit-card spend, app usage) to model customer segments. This can help retail chains choose store locations or optimize inventory. _Data:_ anonymized Wi-Fi and 5G location pings; aggregated credit/debit card spend trends (via partners like Mastercard)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is); third-party location databases (PlaceIQ, SafeGraph). Comcast’s own Xfinity Wi‑Fi hotspot logs or venue networks could feed this.
-   Digital Out-of-Home Advertising (DOOH): Expand on the Quantela/CRI model by offering Comcast’s network of digital billboards and signage as a platform. Advertisers could buy location‑specific DOOH campaigns targeted by time of day and aggregated audience metrics. _Data:_ camera-based counting (Comcast’s video analytics)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/blogs-and-webinars/benefits-of-video-analytics-for-businesses/#:~:text=Customer%20traffic%20and%20heat%20mapping,analysis); pedestrian/vehicle counts (sensors); anonymized mobile location footfall.
-   Smart City and Building Analytics: Package data services for city planners and property managers. Using Comcast’s IoT (MachineQ) sensors, smart lighting and CCTV networks, one could sell insights on traffic congestion, parking utilization, energy use patterns, or pedestrian flows. For example, video analytics at intersections could yield heatmaps of pedestrian crossings. _Data:_ IoT sensor data (traffic counters, environmental sensors); aggregated broadband usage in city zones; video analytics (e.g. for parking lots)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/blogs-and-webinars/benefits-of-video-analytics-for-businesses/#:~:text=Optimize%20space%20utilization)[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/blogs-and-webinars/benefits-of-video-analytics-for-businesses/#:~:text=Customer%20traffic%20and%20heat%20mapping,analysis).
-   Logistics and Supply Chain Optimization: Offer analytics to warehouses and shippers based on IoT and network data. For example, Comcast could use LTE/5G routers on trucks or factories to monitor vehicle routes and cargo dwell times, then provide aggregate logistics reports. _Data:_ GPS/location streams from connected vehicles; sensor data on goods movement (via MachineQ tags); network quality logs.
-   Enterprise Private-Network Analytics: For customers using Comcast’s private 5G networks, sell aggregated operational data. A factory or campus with a 5G network generates rich metadata (device connections, signal maps, equipment usage). Comcast could analyze this to optimize manufacturing throughput or safety (e.g. tracking forklifts or wearables). _Data:_ private 5G network usage logs; IoT sensor feeds (temperature, motion); RFID scans (via connected infrastructure).
-   Cross‑Industry Data Co-ops: Facilitate data partnerships among Comcast’s business clients. For example, anonymized transit or retail data from Comcast networks in one region could be shared with different industries under strict privacy controls. This “data exchange” approach could use aggregated, depersonalized data as a product. _Data:_ diversified – network usage, transaction volumes, mobility flows (from peers or public APIs like Google Mobility) – all anonymized.

Each of these opportunities would rely on first-party data (Comcast’s connectivity networks, devices and apps) combined with third-party data (e.g. credit card spend, demographic segments, public data sources). For example, the idea of mixing private-5G location data with “Axiom-like” consumer profiles has precedent: Comcast’s partnerships (Mastercard, PlaceIQ) already illustrate how combining telco data with purchase/location data can power new insights[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=,confident%20their%20media%20spend%20is)[freewheel.com](https://www.freewheel.com/news/comcast-advertising-unveils-several-industry-first-performance-based-solutions-across-its-portfolio-of-brands#:~:text=%2A%20Location,performance%20while%20protecting%20user%20privacy). Likewise, Comcast’s DOOH signage builds on Quantela’s model of using audience data to fund infrastructure[xfinity.com](https://www.xfinity.com/smartsolutions/news-room/press-releases/expanded-digital-signage/#:~:text=Quantela%20specializes%20in%20end,edge%20features).

In summary, Comcast’s data monetization to date has focused largely on advertising (TV and CTV) and smart-venue solutions. Additional opportunities lie in broader analytics services for retail, mobility, and enterprise IoT. By leveraging its huge broadband user base and cable/Sky infrastructure, Comcast can create new data products – from heatmaps of shopper movement to anonymized traffic reports – that could be sold to advertisers, retailers, cities, and enterprises. These initiatives would use data from Comcast’s networks (Wi-Fi routers, cellular radios, IoT sensors) and partner data platforms to deliver actionable intelligence.

Financial results and analyst coverage (e.g. Monexa analysis[monexa.ai](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/comcast-s-strategic-pivot-advertising-streaming-an-CMCSA-2025-06-17#:~:text=The%20impact%20of%20this%20strategic,These%20figures) and Reuters reporting[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-tops-revenue-estimates-streaming-theme-park-growth-offset-broadband-2024-01-25/#:~:text=Revenue%20at%20the%20company%27s%20Peacock,fourth%20quarter%2C%20to%2031%20million)) provide revenue context. Our opportunity analysis is based on these published strategies and general market trends. (If some opportunities are not explicitly covered in the sources above, they are logical extensions of Comcast’s data capabilities, to be validated with the above data-related partnerships and assets.)
