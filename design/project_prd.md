## Project Title

Interactive AI Innovation Microsite

## Overview

This project involves building a highly immersive, interactive microsite designed to showcase Sutherlandâ€™s strategic AI innovation roadmap. The microsite will enable users to dynamically explore content via interactive charts, graphs, diagrams, and visually engaging elements.

## Objectives

* Deliver immersive and interactive presentation of strategic insights.
* Collect and validate visitor information for personalized experiences and lead generation.
* Provide easy-to-maintain backend infrastructure and data handling.

## Features

### User Registration & Authentication
* **Landing Page** When a user arrives at the site, they encounter a stunning landing page which describes what is the content of this research microsite, well thought out titles and callouts and some quotes from the study without revealing too much. They are then compelled to register for access.
* **Registration Fields:** Name, Email, Title, Phone
* **Registration Authorization** A notification is sent to the administrator email (for now set it to "tiran@tirandagan") who can simply click on "Approve" or "Deny". A confirmation is sent to the user with the determination by the administrator. If approved, they are then allowed to sign in.
* **Validation:** Email verification via activation code or magic link.
* **Login Process:** User enters email; receives magic link or activation code each session.
