# Transforming Comcast Through Data & AI: A Strategic Vision

## Executive Summary

Comcast stands at a pivotal moment in its evolution. With petabytes of data flowing through our networks daily, serving over 32 million customers, and operating across multiple business units—from Xfinity to NBCUniversal to Sky—we possess unparalleled data assets. Yet, our current data monetization efforts yield modest results relative to our potential. While our addressable advertising generates $378M quarterly and Peacock ad revenue exceeds $1B annually, these represent a fraction of what's possible.

As your Chief Data & AI Officer, I will transform Comcast into a data-driven powerhouse, unlocking $2B+ in new revenue streams while reducing operational costs by 30% through AI-powered automation. My vision builds on proven success: at Cognizant, I built the Industry Solutions Group from zero to $200M in revenue, leading 400 professionals in delivering AI-driven transformation.

This report outlines a comprehensive strategy to:
- Unify our fragmented data ecosystem into a single, intelligent platform
- Deploy AI at scale across customer experience, network operations, and content
- Build an AI-first culture through systematic upskilling and governance
- Deliver $500M in new revenue within 18 months through targeted quick wins

## Chapter 1: Data & AI at Comcast - Current State and Vision

### The Data Goldmine We're Sitting On
